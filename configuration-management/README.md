# Configuration Management in C

Configuration management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, uniquely identified, and modified.

We select the following topics from a wide range of configuration management techniques:

* [Build Automation](building/)

* [Debugging](debugging/)
 
* [Test Automation](testing/)

* [Source Code Versioning](versioning/) 

* [Documentation](documentation/)

* [Coding Standard](coding-standard/)
