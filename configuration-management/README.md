# Configuration Management in C

Configuration management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, uniquely identified, and modified.

We select the following topics from a wide range of configuration management techniques:

* [Build Automation](building/)

* [Debugging](debugging)
   - [Debugging Single Files](debugging/single-files/)
   - [Debugging Multiple Files](debugging/multiple-files/)
 
* [Test Automation](testing)
   - [Unity Test Framework](testing/unit-tests/) 

* [Source Code Versioning](versioning) 

* [Documentation](documentation)
   - [Source Code Documentation](documentation/doxygen)
   - [Project Documentation](documentation/markdown)

* [Coding Standard](coding-standard)
