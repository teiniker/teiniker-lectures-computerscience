# Debugging in VS Code

## Debugging Executables Built with Make

To debug an executable which we have built using `make`, we have to change the `launch.json` file: 
* **Remove the "preLaunchTask" element** to stop automatic compiling before the debugging:

  Remove the following line:
  ```
    "preLaunchTask": "C/C++: gcc build active file",
  ```  

* **Change the "program" element** to point to the executable created by make within the `build` folder:

  Change from:  
  ```
    "program": "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}", 
  ```  
  to:	 
  ```
    "program": "${fileDirname}/build/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",    
  ```    

Note that we have to open the `main.c` file before we start the debugger because the `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`
variable contains the current opened file's basename.

Here the final `launch.json` file:
```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "gcc - Build and debug active file",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${fileDirname}/build/${fileBasenameNoExtension}", //!! change
            "args": [],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
            "environment": [],
            "externalConsole": false,
            "MIMode": "gdb",
            "setupCommands": [
                {
                    "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                    "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                    "ignoreFailures": true
                }
            ],
//!! remove "preLaunchTask": "C/C++: gcc build active file",
            "miDebuggerPath": "/usr/bin/gdb"
        }
    ]
}
```
