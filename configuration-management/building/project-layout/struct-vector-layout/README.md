# Project Layout

Separating sources (`src`) from headers (`include`) and build artifacts
(`build`) keeps the project clean and scalable. It clarifies which files are
edited by developers, which define public interfaces, and which are generated by
the build. This structure improves readability, avoids accidental edits to
compiled outputs, and makes it easier to extend the project (e.g., adding tests
or libraries) without clutter.

```bash
├── build
│   ├── main
│   ├── main.o
│   └── vector.o
├── include
│   └── vector.h
├── Makefile
└── src
    ├── main.c
    └── vector.c
```

The build process uses `make` targets that compile each source file into an
object file inside `build/`, then links them into the final executable
`build/main`. 

```bash
$ mkdir -p build
$ gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -Iinclude -c src/main.c -o build/main.o
$ gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -Iinclude -c src/vector.c -o build/vector.o
$ gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -Iinclude build/main.o build/vector.o -o build/main
$ build/main
```

The include path is set to `include/` so `#include <vector.h>`
resolves correctly. Running `make` builds the program and then executes it via
the `run` target. 

`make clean` removes the `build/` directory.
