# Build Automation

A **build process** is a series of steps that transforms our creative artifacts into deliverable software.

Having an automated build process lets us produce our software at the **push of a button**.

We need builds which are:
* **Complete** builds are made from scratch using only the steps specified in the build script.
    
* **Repeatable** The key to producing repeatable builds is to store the build file and all the build inputs 
    in a version control system.

* **Informative** builds give valuable information to us so that we always know the health of our software. 
    If the build fails, we want to know quickly why.
    
 * **Schedulable** Since everything that goes into making a build is available in the version control system, 
    a computer can easily generate fresh builds many times per day or on demand whenever we want 
    (e.g. nightly builds, continuous integration).
 
 * **Portable** Running a build should not be dependent on any particular IDE, a machine’s IP address, 
    or the directory from which it’s run.



## GNU make

The program **make** is designed to aid the programmer in compiling and linking programs which consists of many 
source files.

The program `make` allows us to specify the dependencies between source files 
and the commands that generates the final program in a so called `Makefile`.

The `Makefile` contains the following sections:
* **Comments**: Any line starting with a hash mark `#` is a comment.
* **Macros**: A macro has the format `name = value` where `name` is any valid identifier 
    and `value` is the text that will be substituted whenever make sees `$(name)`.
* **Explicit rules** tell make what commands are needed to create the program.
* Default rules

Explicit rules can take several forms, the most common is:
```
target: source [source2] [source3] ...
    command
    [command2]
    [command3]
    ...
```
where **target** is the name of a file to create.

It is created out of the source file **source**. If the target is created out of several files, they
are all listed.
This list should include any header files included by the source file as well.

The **command** that generates the target is specified on the next line.
Sometimes we need more than one commend to create the target.
Commands are listed one per line.
**Each is indented by a tab**.

_Example_: struct-vector-modular
```
CFLAGS=-std=c17 -g -Wall -I.
CC=gcc

all: build run

build:
	mkdir -p build

build/vector.o: vector.c vector.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c vector.c -o build/vector.o

build/main.o: main.c vector.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c -o build/main.o

build/main: build/vector.o build/main.o 
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) build/main.o build/vector.o -o build/main

run: build/main
	build/main

clean:
	rm -rf build/
```

When we call `make` to execute the `Makefile`, we get the following output:
```
mkdir -p build
gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -I. -c vector.c -o build/vector.o
gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -I. -c main.c -o build/main.o
gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -I. build/main.o build/vector.o -o build/main

build/main
[1.000000, 2.000000, 3.000000]
[4.000000, 5.000000, 6.000000]
[5.000000, 7.000000, 9.000000]
[-3.000000, -3.000000, -3.000000]
[2.000000, 4.000000, 6.000000]
[-3.000000, 6.000000, -3.000000]```

Note that we compile the source files (`*.h` and `*.c`) into **object files** (`*.o`), link the together 
into an **executable**, and run that application.

All **build artifacts** are stored in a temporary `build/` directory. 
```
├── build
│   ├── main
│   ├── main.o
│   └── vector.o
```

Executing the `clean` target removes this directory from our project again:
```
$ make clean
rm -rf build/
```

To see all commands which will be executed by make, we can use the **-n flag** 
to print out all build steps **without executing them**:
```
$ make -n
mkdir -p build
gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -I. -c vector.c -o build/vector.o
gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -I. -c main.c -o build/main.o
gcc -std=c17 -g -Wall -I. build/main.o build/vector.o -o build/main
build/main
```
